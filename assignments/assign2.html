	<h3>Question 1</h3>

	<p><b>1.a. How is the GET method different from POST when it comes HTML form submission?</b></p>
	<p>The GET method sends the form data through the URL, while POST method sends the data through the body of the HTTP request, so the data is not shown in the URL.</p>

	<p><b>1.b. Identify several factors/reasons (min of 3 each) for choosing one method (GET/POST) over the other.</b></p>
	<p>
		<b>GET</b><br>
		- Useful for when a user wants to bookmark the result<br>
		- Better when there is non-secure data, like google search<br>
		- Can be cached<br>
		<br>
		<b>POST</b><br>
		- Useful when there is sensitive data that you don't want users to know about it<br>
		- Has no size limitations (since the length of an url is limited, GET method has limit as well)<br>
		- Can upload files
	</p>

	<p><b>1.c. What does it mean when one gets a HTTP status code in the range of 400-499? What about in the range of 500-599?</b></p>
	<p>HTTP code in the range of 500-599 is when the server is awared it has erred os is incapable of performing the request. HTTP code in the range of 400-499 is for cases in which the client seems to have erred.</p>

	<p><b>1.d. What does HTTP status code 403 mean? What about 404? What about 500?</b></p>
	<p>403 means forbidden, the server understood the request but is can't send an answer. 404 means not found, the server has not found anything matching the URL. 500 means internal server error, the server encountered an unexpected condition which prevent it for finishin the request.</p>
