    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>My name is Lucas Vieira and I'm a exchange student from Brazil. This is my first time studying abroad, I'm here since August of 2015 and will stay here for 1 year. I used to work as a Backend Developer back in Brazil so I have experience with Web Development and Databases, mostly using <a href="http://cakephp.org/" target="_blank">CakePHP</a>, a PHP framework. Last semester I took IT 275 so I have a few Java experience as well.</p>
    <p>In the next summer I'm supposed to take an internship before going back to Brazil and I'm looking for a internship in the Web Development area, so I'm looking forward to take this class.</p>
    <p>Here is a picture of me in Miami on the last winter break:</p>

    <h3>Javascript</h3>
    <p><a href="javascript:;" onclick="hello()">Click here</a> to see something fun.</p>
    <p>And below you can see the <b>code</b> I use to do it:</p>

    <pre>
var firstName = prompt("Please enter your first name", "Harry");
var lastName = prompt("Please enter your last name", "Potter");

alert("Hello " + lastName + ", " + firstName + "! Welcome to ITK353.");</pre>

    <h3>Mashups: The new breed of Web app</h3>
    <p>A mashup application is basically comprised of a website and API/content providers. Mashups sites are nowadays great for users because they get the best of both worlds. An example is <a href="http://feedly.com">feedly.com</a>, a single website where you can read all of your favorite blogs, publications and Youtube channels. They make use of API's, RSS and other technologies to help the user to have all the content they want in a easier way.</p>
    <p>Mashups applications also have some technical challenges, such as data quality. If the content provider doesn't use an API, developers are often forced to make use of screen scraping. Screen scraping is the use of tools to parse and analyze content that was originally written for users. The problem is that using screen scraping you can't make sure the content will always be available, since most of the content providers update their contents regularly.</p>

    <h3>Google will search before you even ask</h3>
    <p>Google wants to show you results of things you don't even yet know you need. That's Google CEO Eric Schmidt's vision of the future. He wants that when you're walking around a big city and you're near restaurants, your phone will alert you about a near restaurant with the same type of food you liked to eat a few months ago.</p>
    <p>They also said they already have the majority of technology need to do that, which is basically Google Maps application plus geolocation, which exists on most of mobile devices. But the bigger issue is privacy. For this kind of technology to work properly, you would need to be connected the whole time and Google would know where you have been the entire day. And that could scare most people.</p>
